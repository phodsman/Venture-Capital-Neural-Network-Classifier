# Venture-Capital-Neural-Network-Classifier

This application attempts to use a neural network analysis to predict the success of applications for funding for a venture capital firm. A sample dataset was provided for analysis.

First the data will be prepared for analysis. Then several models of neural networks will be run on the data to see what rate of successful prediction can be achieved. The accuracies of the various models will be displayed and compared. The neural network models will be saved in HDF5 format.
